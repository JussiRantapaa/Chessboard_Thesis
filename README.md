Repository for my bachelor's thesis automated chess board. Has all the software files i used when the project was demoed to my supervisors.

  The chess pieces have neodynium magnets on the bottom and the board uses Hall effect sensors to detect piece movements made on the board.
  
  The hall effect sensors are connnected to 8 8-bit shift registers that are then read through SPI to detect changes made on the board.
  
  Based on the picked up piece, the possible moves are then displayed through LEDs.
  
  The "Opponent's" move  is displayed by illuminating the starting and ending square.
